<h2>What?</h2><p>TemplateView is an extension of <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone">Backbone</a>&#39;s View class, and is inspired by
<a href="https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette">Marionette</a> and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">React</a>.  It aims to enable you to build a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux</a> style
architechture with Backbone&#39;s core components. Essentially you create a tree of
View+Template combos and render the entire tree each time the data&#39;s state changes.
This offers the opportunity to design schemas that work really well with templates
and keep views small.</p>
<p>The extension aims to offer template designers more control over user experience
while staying outside of the core codebase. It is built around the use of inline
templates as a means of efficient prototyping.  The default template engine is 
<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks">Nunjucks</a>, which offers a great sandbox with just enough logic to set up the
various UI states that an app may require.</p>
<p>Much like how React works with a virtual dom to allow for this, TemplateView works
with <a href="https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom">morphdom</a> to accomplish DOM diffing.</p>
